## If you like this list, make sure to star it!
I've got these links from multiple sources. Like haleyschool.com, [chromebook-utilities](https://github.com/S-PScripts/chromebook-utilities), [io.forums (forum number 14464)](https://iogames.forum/t/list-of-all-the-working-unbl0cked-pr0xies-for-school-dec-2023/14464), [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nK6tJb-sxfrrQJM9bSWcAV-Fo7jHasd_dWpj4VEVg5E/edit) plus from a list that my friends and I made. 
 ### FYI: <br>
<h4>These are a list of proxies (unblockers) that work FOR ME on school chromebooks. </h4>
  
  I have CK Authenticator G3 and a internet filter. github.io links are blocked, so is pages.dev links, replit, vercel, herokuaiopp, railway, glitch, cyclic, koyeb, render, ALL are blocked. <br>
  A prxy is an unblocker. <br>
  Examples of apps are like youtube, discord, roblox, AI, pinterest, and more. <br> 
  Examples of games is Moto X3M, Cookie Clicker, 1v1.LOL, Bitlife, etc. <br>
  hop.sh links MAY be down during school or any time. <br>
here is an [url opener](https://www.openallurls.com/) to save some time.

## Skiovox | Unrestricted Chrome (you can install extensions, go to any site, etc.) | Found from [ext-remover](https://github.com/3kh0/ext-remover), exploit made by AkaButNice and Bypassi
Follow the instructions found from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tl8eP26MFRejHO38H5HwMLl2VaQrtn0Z/preview)<br>
If this isn't working for you, here are some tips from my experience doing this: <br>
- Make sure to press alt shift s, NOT ctrl shift s or something else
- Make sure to completely wait for the "Network Available" Screen on step 1.4
- Make sure to install the Skiovox Helper extension from Stage 3 by scrolling down further. 
- When configuring our browser shortcuts, press the buttons on your keyboard to execute the shortcut, don't type it out like ctrl shift s, actually do it.
