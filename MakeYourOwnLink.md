### Making links via freeDNS
1. Go to https://freedns.afraid.org/
2. This is probably your first time, so click "Sign Up for Free." If you already have an account, go to step 5.
3. Fill out all of the information in the boxes.
	> For your first and last name, you don't have to put your real name.
	
	> For the user ID,  you can put anything.
	
	> If your email gets banned for whatever reason, use a temporary email provider like [TempMail](https://temp-mail.org/), but your created link may expire.
	
4. Finish signing up by completing the activation and going to your email.
5. Now we are going to register the link. Go to this page in freeDNS: freedns.afraid.org/domain/registry
6. Click a domain that you would like to use. (e.g. chickenkiller.com)
	> Make sure to select a domain that is unblocked for you. Domains that have a low popularity are probably unblocked. 
	
8. In the configurations page, make sure "A" record type is selected (it should be already).
9. Enter the name of the subdomain, it can be anything. (subdomainName.chosenDomain.com)
10. For the destination, it depends on what unblocker you want to use. You can try to googling it or joining discord servers, here is a helpful table I created:

| Unblocker   |  Type | IP Destination |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Abyss     | Web browser|`88.99.136.115`     |
| Astroid   | Games, Unblocker, Emulators, Apps|`5.161.68.227`        |
| Tinf0il    | Unblocker, Games, Apps |`129.213.65.72` | 
| Artclass | Unblocker, Games, Apps |`193.26.115.218`|
| Shadow | Web Browser | `104.243.38.18`|
| Other unblockers have specific tutorials in their discord servers. To find their discord server, go to the [Proxy Discord Servers section](https://github.com/wea-f/ByePassHub/blob/main/mainUnblockers.md#caution-many-of-these-servers-will-ban-you-for-leaking-leaks-publicly-use-it-for-private-use-only) in the main Unblockers file.  

10. After putting the IP destination to your subdomain, press "save." Complete the captcha
11. Wait a couple minutes for your site to register and go to the link you created!
