### This is a collection of exploits, and directions to do them.<br>
### These exploits can range from disabling extensions, unblocking any site, getting the school's wifi password, or completely unrestricting your entire chromebook
These are from [balls-remover](https://github.com/3kh0/balls-remover) and [this](https://github.com/Brandon421-ops/Exploits-And-Hacks) <br>
Most of exploits are found by [bypassi](https://buymeacoffee.com/bypassi), [Brandon421-ops](https://github.com/Brandon421-ops),  [mundaneunblocking](https://github.com/mundaneunblocking), [AkaButNice](https://github.com/Aka-but-nice), and [adding2210](https://ading.dev/)<br>

### Skiovox | Unrestricted CHROME 
Follow the instructions found from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tl8eP26MFRejHO38H5HwMLl2VaQrtn0Z/preview)<br>
If that's blocked, try [this](https://github.com/3kh0/balls-remover/blob/main/img/skiovox.pdf) <br>
This requires you to shutdown your chromebook, so open those links on another device or just write down the instructions on a piece of paper. <br>
If you are confused on the directions, here are some tips from my experience doing this: <br>
- Make sure to press alt shift s, NOT ctrl shift s or something else
- Make sure to COMPLETELY wait for the "Network Available" Screen on step 1.4
- Make sure to install the Skiovox Helper extension from Stage 3 by scrolling down further. 
- When configuring our browser shortcuts, press the buttons on your keyboard to execute the shortcut, don't type it out like ctrl shift s, actually do it.

### Unblocked Youtube Videos
1. **Copy the youtube video link** you want to watch. To find a video, search one on Google or go to `https://socialblade.com` and find a youtuber you want to watch.
2. Paste the link in a new tab, don't enter it yet.
3. Notice the format of the link, it could be `https://youtube.com/watch?v=SOMERANDOMCHARACTERS` or `https://youtu.be/SOMERANDOMCHARACTERS` or something entirely different.
4. You have to **find the video's id** (a 11 character string, specific to the video), so by deleting the `youtube.com/watch?v=` part, you are left with the video id. <br> For example, I have this link `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` <br> To get the id, delete the `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=` part of the link. <br> Now I have the video ID, which is `dQw4w9WgXcQ`
5. If you don't have the `https://youtube.com/watch?v=` format, try to locate the 11 character video ID, remember it is completely random for every video, and it contains capital letters and lowercase ones too.
6. Now you got the video id, **substitute it** for this link `https://youtube.com/embed/VIDEOIDHERE`
7. Following my example, the link should now be `https://youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ`
8. Paste this link on another tab and go to it. **If it is blocked, try this link instead,** `https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIDEOIDHERE`
### LTMEAT | Disable extensions | 
1. Get your extension's id that you want to disable by going to `chrome://extensions`
2. Click on the "Details" button on the extension you want to disable
3. On the URL in the search bar, you find something like this: `chrome://extensions/?id=odoanpnonilogofggaohhkdkdgbhdljp`
4. Get the 32 character lowercase string after the ?id=, this will be your id. So for this example, the id is: `odoanpnonilogofggaohhkdkdgbhdljp`
5. Substitute the id for this url: ```chrome-extension://EXTENSIONIDHERE/manifest.json```, so the example would now be chrome-extension://odoanpnonilogofggaohhkdkdgbhdljp/manifest.json
6. Go to the url you just created on another tab, you'll see a bunch of code and stuff.
7. Bookmark the page you just opened (called it "A") if you wish, if the bookmarks aren't visible, press `ctrl shift b`. 
8. Then, bookmark `chrome://kill` (B) and `chrome://hang` (C) right clicking on the bookmarks bar, adding a page, replacing the name with something memorable, and replacing the URL with the command.
9. On the extension page (A), click the `chrome://kill` bookmark (B). The page should crash. You should already have the next step prepared. 
10. Instantly start spam clicking the `chrome://hang` (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming (press the refresh key on your keyboard, above the number 4 or `ctrl`+`R`). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page. 
11. If the extension page (bookmark A) no longer loads, then LTMEAT worked! You can cloes the tabs now. If nothing loads, you probably reloaded too late or spammed too slowly.
12. Restart your computer to go back to normal.

### LTMEAT Flood | Disable extensions 
1. Create a bookmark folder and paste the extension page (go to LTMEAT steps 1-5 to get the extension page, make sure it ends with manifest.json) many times. (800 minimum is the usual) You should add the extension settings page (e.g. `chrome://extensions/?id=odoanpnonilogofggaohhkdkdgbhdljp`) at the start of the folder.
2. Right-click the folder and open all in a new window.
3. Close the window with all those tabs after they appear.
4. Open the folder in a new window again, and Chrome should hang (forever reloading) those tabs 
5. Flip the `Allow access to file URLs` switch in the extension settings, and then you've bypassed the patch, and the exploit is working (you can close the tabs now).

**Not working?** Ensure you open a large set, but not too large, of extension tabs (`_/generated_background_page.html` or `/manifest.json`) for a permanent freeze. <br> If your chromebook restarts or shuts down during step 2, lessen the number of pages in the folder, vice versa for increasing the tabs.
### LTMEAT PRINT | Disable extensions 
1. Go to the extension page that has all the code in it (LTMEAT steps 1-5). and hit Ctrl+P. A print window should show up with a number of pages in the top right.
2. Do everything you can to increase that number. Shrink down margins, increase scale, change layout to landscape, anything you can.
The higher you can get that number, the longer the effect will last. 
3. Hit reload (above the button 4). The page should start hanging.
4. Go to your extension's settings page (e.g. `chrome://extensions/?id=odoanpnonilogofggaohhkdkdgbhdljp`).
5. Duplicate your printing tab (right click and press duplicate) and go back to your extension's settings page.
6. Flip the `Allow Access to file URLS` switch.

4. Click signin options.
5. Click signin with Github.
